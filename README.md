#VLN56

This is our project for the course VLN1, we are group 56!

This program, simply put, is a client for interacting with a database. The theme of this database are computer scientists and computers.

##How to use this program:

##Computer Scientists:
![ShowMoreScientists] (https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Show_More_Scientist.jpg?raw=true)

In this window the user is able to learn about the fascinating world of computer science by choosing Computer Scientists, Computers or Connections between the two, in the dropdown box located at the top left side.

The sorting order can be changed from Ascending to Descending by clicking on the Name, Birth Year, Death Year or Sex tab, located under the dropdown box. Note that only one sorting option is available at a time. 

In this example the list is sorted by Name and in ascending order, where (A) Ada Lovelace is first. To display more information on each computer scientist, the user can simply highlight the row of interest by clicking on it and then clicking on show more tab, located at the mid bottom of the program. This displays profession and a short description of the person chosen.

##Add a Computer Scientist:

![AddComputerScientist](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Add_Computer_Scientist.jpg?raw=true)

To add a computer scientist simply choose Computer Scientist in the dropdown box and click on the add button at the bottom of the program window. A new window will appear where you can input Name, Birth Year, Death Year, Sex, Profession and a short Description, although Description is optional. Once completed all the user needs to do is press Add. 

##Search for a Computer Scientist:

![SearchScientist](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Search_Computer_Scientists.jpg?raw=true)

To search for a computer scientist the user can choose Computer Scientist in the dropdown box and then clicks on the search button. A search field will appear at the bottom of the program window. The search is sorted by Name, Birth Year, Death Year, Sex, Profession and Description and once one has been chosen, the user can search by a certain substring. In the example below, the user chooses to search by Name and puts the name Ada in the substring.

##Computers:
![SearchComputers](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Search_Computers.jpg?raw=true)

Here is an example of the options available for Computers. The same as above applies for ascending or descending sorted order. The information available is Name, Construction Year, Type and whether it was built or not. Show more displays a short description of the computer.
