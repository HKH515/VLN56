 Charles Babbage|Mathematician|A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage is best remembered for originating the concept of a programmable computer. Considered a "father of the computer", Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex designs. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among the many polymaths of his century.|1791|1871|1
 Ada Lovelace|Mathematician|A British mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.|1815|1852|0
 Grace Hopper|Computer Scientist|American computer scientist and United States Navy Rear Admiral. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944, invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and was one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches (in one instance, removing a moth from a computer).|1906|1992|0
 Anita Borg|Computer scientist|An American computer scientist and the founding director of the Institute for Women and Technology (IWT). Anita Borg died sadly in April of 2003 from brain cancer at the age of 54. Beginning in 1997, the institute was supported and funded by Xerox. Her goals for the institute were threefold: • bring non-technical women into the design process • encourage more women to become scientists • and help the industry, academia, and the government accelerate these changes.|1949|2003|0
 Shafi Goldwasser|Computer scientist|A theoretical computer scientist, two-time recipient of the Godel Prize. She is the RSA Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Goldwasser's research areas include complexity theory, cryptography and computational number theory.|1958|NA|0
 Frances E. Allen|Computer scientist|An American computer scientist and pioneer in the field of optimizing compilers. She was also the first female recipient of the ACM'S Turing Award in 2006. Her achievements include seminal work in compilers, code optimization, and parallelization.|1932|NA|0
 Erna Schneider|Mathematician|In 1954, after teaching for a number of years at Swarthmore College, she began a research career at Bell Laboratories. While there, she invented a computerized switching system for telephone traffic, to replace existing hard-wired, mechanical switching equipment. For this ground-breaking achievement -- the principles of which are still used today -- she was awarded one of the first software patents ever issued (Patent #3,623,007, Nov. 23, 1971). At Bell Labs, she became the first female supervisor of a technical department.|1926|NA|0
 Alan Turing|Computer scientist|A British pioneering computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.|1912|1954|1
 Linus Torvalds|Engineer|A Finnish-American software engineer, who is the creator of the Linux kernel and for a long time, principal developer; that became the kernel for operating systems (and many distributions of each), such as GNU and years later Android and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed revision control system git.|1969|NA|1
 Edsger W. Dijkstra|Computer scientist|A Dutch computer scientist and mathematical scientist. A theoretical physicist by training, he worked as a programmer at the Mathematics Centrum (Amsterdam) from 1952 to 1962. He was a professor of mathematics at the Eindhoven University of Technology (1962-1984) and a research fellow at the Burroughs Corporation (1973-1984). He held the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin from 1984 until 1999, and retired as Professor Emeritus in 1999.|1930|2002|1
 Jon Von Neuman|Mathematician/Physicist | A Hungarian-American pure and applied mathematician, physicist, inventor, and polymath. He made major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, fluid dynamics and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics. He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics, in the development of functional analysis, a principal member of the Manhattan Project and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (as one of the few originally appointed), and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor, and the digital computer.|1903|1957|1
 Donald Knuth|Computer scientist|An American computer scientist, mathematician, and professor emeritus at Stanford University. He is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming. Knuth has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms". He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the asymptotic notation.|1938|NA|1
 Claude Shannon|Mathematician/Engineer|An American mathematician, electronic engineer, and cryptographer known as "the father of information theory”. Shannon is famous for having founded information theory with a landmark paper that he published in 1948. He is perhaps equally well known for founding both digital computer and digital circuit design theory in 1937, when, as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical, numerical relationship. Shannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense during World War II, including his basic work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications.|1916|2001|1
