#VLN56

This is our project for the course VLN1, we are group 56!

This program, simply put, is a client for interacting with a database. The theme of this database is computer scientists and computers.

##How to use this program:

##Computer Scientists:
![ShowMoreScientists] (https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Show_More_Scientist.jpg?raw=true)

In this window the user is able to learn about the fascinating world of computer science by choosing Computer Scientists, Computers or Connections between the two, in the dropdown box located at the top left side.

The sorting order can be changed from Ascending to Descending by clicking on the Name, Birth Year, Death Year or Sex tab, located under the dropdown box. Note that only one sorting option is available at a time. 

In this example the list is sorted by Name and in ascending order, where (A) Ada Lovelace is first. To display more information on each computer scientist, the user can simply highlight the row of interest by clicking on it and then clicking on show more tab, located at the mid bottom of the program. This displays profession and a short description of the person chosen.

##Add a Computer Scientist:

![AddComputerScientist](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Add_Computer_Scientist.jpg?raw=true)

To add a computer scientist simply choose Computer Scientist in the dropdown box and click on the add button at the bottom of the program window. A new window will appear where the user can input Name, Birth Year, Death Year, Sex, Profession and a short Description, although Description is optional. Once completed all the user needs to do is press Add and the computer scientist has been added to the database. Note that symbols and numbers will not work in the name, sex and profession fields and symbols or letters will not work in the Birth Year and Death Year fields.

##Search for a Computer Scientist:

![SearchScientist](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Search_Computer_Scientists.jpg?raw=true)

To search for a computer scientist the user can choose Computer Scientist in the dropdown box and then clicks on the search button. A search field will appear at the bottom of the program window. The search is sorted by Name, Birth Year, Death Year, Sex, Profession and Description and once one has been chosen, the user can search by a certain substring. In the example below, the user chooses to search by Name and puts the name Ada in the substring. 

![SearchAda](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Search_Ada.jpg?raw=true)

Note that symbols and numbers will not work in the name, sex and profession feilds and symbols or letters will not work in the Birth Year and Death Year fields.


##Computers:
![Computers](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Computers.jpg?raw=true)

Here is an example of the options available for Computers. The same as above applies for Ascending or Descending sorted order. The information available is Name, Construction Year, Type and whether it was built or not. Show more, displays a short description of the computer.

##Add a Computer:

![AddComputer](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Add_Computer.jpg?raw=true)

To add a computer the user can choose Computer in the dropdown box and then clicks on the Add button at the bottom of the program. A new window will appear where the user can input Name, Construction Year, whether is was Built or not, Type, and a short Description, although Description is optional. Once completed all the user needs to do is press Add and the computer has been added to the database. Note that symbols and numbers will not work in the name field and symbols or letters will not work in the Construction Year field.

##Search for Computer:

![SearchComputer](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Search_Computers.jpg?raw=true)

To search for a computer the user can choose Computer in the dropdown box and then clicks on the search button. A search field will appear at the bottom of the program window. The search is sorted by Name, Construction Year, Built, Type, and Description and once one has been chosen, the user can search by a certain substring. In the example below, the user chooses to search by Type and inputs Abstract in the substring.

![SearchAbstract](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Search_Abstract.jpg?raw=true)

Note that symbols and numbers will not work in the name feild and symbols or letters will not work in the Construction Year field.

##Connections:

![ViewConnections](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/View_Connections.jpg?raw=true)

To view the connections that are already in the database the user can choose Connections in the dropdown box. 

##Add a Connection:

![AddConnection](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Add_Connection.jpg?raw=true)

To add a connection the user can choose Connection in the dropdown box and then clicks on the Add button at the bottom of the program. A new window will appear where the user can choose a computer scientist that is already in the database and link him or her to a computer that is also already in the database. If the user wants to connect a computer scientist that is already available to a computer that is not, the user must first add the computer into the database and vice versa. (See "Add Computer" above)

##Search Connections:

![SearchConnections](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Search_Connection.jpg?raw=true)

To search for a connection between a computer scientist and a computer or vice versa, the user can choose Connections in the dropdown box and then clicks on the search button located at the bottom of the program window. A new dropbox with the option to choose Computer Scientist or Computers will appear on the left and a dropbox with the names of either computer scientists or computers appears on the right. In this example the user chooses Computer Scientists and Ada Lovelace. The computer that Ada Lovelace is connected to, along with Construction Year, Type and whether it was built or not appears in the main window. 

##Remove:

![Remove](https://github.com/HKH515/VLN56/blob/qt/Images/Remove.jpg?raw=true)

To remove any information that has been saved to the database the user needs to choose either Computer Scientists, Computers or Connections from the dropdown box, highlight the information that is to be removed and click on the Remove button located at the bottom of the program.

##Extras:

- Searching by substring in any column in both Scientists and Computers
- Removing computer Scientists, Computers and Connections
- View all computers connected to a certain scientist (Connection->search)
- View all scientists connected to a certain computer
- On the fly search (filtering results everytime a letter is entered) 
- Sorting ascending/descending by each column in scientist and computer table
- Really good README
- Changed the color scheme for background
- Changed the color scheme for the highlights
- Changed the color scheme for choices
- Changed fonts

There is a zip file including the pictures of rough drafts for how the program should turn out.
